Part 1 [here]({% link _posts/2024-10-20-dissecting-secondary-chip-protocol.md %}).

# Moving forward

After the spectacular failure of my last attempt, I needed to think of a better way to sniff the inter-chip-comminication while actually connected to the mains. 

The best thing I could think of would be to eliminate any kind of wired connection - so I'm thinking of something like this:
![concept illustration](/assets/images/2024-11-12-dissecting-secondary-chip-protocol-2/concept.png)

Both RX lines on the external MCU can be then wirelessly logged somewhere. This would be pretty easy to do with another MCU flashed with esphome for example, since it supports uart logging in a pretty simple way.

# But...

I've looked into my little stash of mcu boards, and here's what I'm working with here:
![MCU stash](/assets/images/2024-11-12-dissecting-secondary-chip-protocol-2/mcu-stash.jpg)

I have no ESPs or Pi pico W's left! There's not much, and the only wireless boards here are the Ardino Nano RP2040 Connect and the Nano 33 IOT. Neither are supported by esphome, so we'll need to use something more custom I guess...

*While writing this, I suddenly realized that I also ahve a few SBCs that could be used as well! It would be very versatile if it worked, but... I've had tons of issues with UART on Raspberry Pi before, even just enabling it can be tricky, so let's stick to the Arduinos for now*

# Let's figure it out!

All right, so what I can do is just install the Arduino IDE and whip out a quick sketch to dump Serial data somewhere over WiFi. Right? Maybe there's even an existing project I could use?

Well... Looks like the wifi chip on both of these is supported by the [WiFiNINA](https://docs.arduino.cc/libraries/wifinina/) library. It has some examples of HTTP servers (score!), and a UDP client/server (could also be a good idea), but if I'm going this route I'd like a web interface that keeps logging the serial data continuously.

For context, my primary background is in web dev, so I'm reasonably knowledgable in how to achieve that. I've looked into WebSocket implementations for Arduino, but they all seem to focus on a WebSockets *client*, not *server*. And I *really* don't want to implement the Websockets protocol myself: that seems like a huge hustle.

So maybe a better alternatives could be server-sent events? I've been looking for an excuse to use them for something for years, but for the things I do they never really fit well due to their unique downsides. But, they are *very* simple to implement in the server code!

Starting with the examples from WiFiNINA, I was able to throw together a simulated thing that just prints the same messsage over and over:

![receiving events](/assets/images/2024-11-12-dissecting-secondary-chip-protocol-2/events.png)

And after some more poking around (and getting confused with the different frameworks that can be used with my Nano RP2040 Connect in Arduino), I can pipe UART into it!

![getting uart](/assets/images/2024-11-12-dissecting-secondary-chip-protocol-2/with-uart.png)

Now, let's finally connect it to the switch and see what's up. I've soldered some wires to the signal contacts and reassembled the dimmer with them sticking out.

![assembled](/assets/images/2024-11-12-dissecting-secondary-chip-protocol-2/assembled.jpg)

...aand I hooked up the wrong board. But once I connected the right one, it actually worked!

I'm not getting anythin on UART2, and I think the BAUD might not be right, but that's a start. I've tried switching the UART lines around, and was still only getting info on UART1. That's good news, since it means something's wrong with my code and not how I soldered the headers to the dimmer - I don't want to go poking around there again!

According to the RTL8720 datasheet the default UART BAUD is 115200, so let's try that one next. Over a few hours, I've updated the code to be able to update the baud on-the-fly (that was surprisingly hard, as the Arduino just kept crushing for seemingly no reason...). So I've tried all the standard bauds from the CMS8S5880 datasheet and still can't see anything to point to which one is right ü§∑ Some rates seem more "stable" than others (i.e. periodic messages come with same content, not changing once in a while), but that's about it.

In that case, let's try to detect the actual baud! After a bit of searching, I found [a ready implementation](https://www.electronicsforu.com/electronics-projects/hardware-diy/uart-automatic-baud-rate-detector#:~:text=Once%20the%20arduino%20sketch%20is,one%20of%20the%20test%20results.) that I should be able to just plug into my sketch.

With a new button that sends a request for BAUD detection, we get about 111111 bps, which is pretty close to 115200! Seems like that's the BAUD to use after all.

# Actual dumps

With that in mind, here's the data I recorded after turning the dimmer on, increasing the brightness by one step and turning it off again:

Thanks to the photos from before, I know that the yellow wire (first dump) goes to brown wire on the inside. So, the first dump is data going from the RTL to the CMS, and the second one is the reverse! Now we can finally start digging into these, but that's another post üòÅ
