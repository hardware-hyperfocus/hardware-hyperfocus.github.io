# What?

Soo I have a few Kasa and Tapo smart dimmers. Thay are good and cheap, but what's missing for me is an OSS firmware with local-only fulfillment.

Let's try to get esphome on it!

# Starting the journey

After googling around, I wasn't able to find any info on the hardware in these, so let's open one and see for ourselves!

Ta-da-da-dam... that's a RTL8720CM! It's (mostly) supported in esphome thtough libretiny, so that's cool!

# How does it actually work?

Well idk, let's reverse it and figure out!
